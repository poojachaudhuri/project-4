# 311 complaints related to heat and hot water

This project analyses 311 service requests related to heat and hot water from NYC Open Data. The time period for the data is 2020 to 2022. It explores the complaints on the borough level, zip code level, and traces the building which has an outsized number of complaints. The data has been normalized by the zip code level population data gathered from U.S. Census Bureau. The result is this story - [Bronx leads city in heat and hot water complaints. One building has an outsized share of complaints.] ("https://poojachaudhuri.github.io/project-4/")
